## üèÅ Introduction to Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

In simple terms:

> ML = Learning from data + Making predictions or decisions

## üîç Types of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**

* Data has input (X) and output (Y).
* Model learns a mapping between X ‚Üí Y.
  **Examples:**
  Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**

* Data has only input (X); no labels.
* Model finds hidden patterns or structures.
  **Examples:**
  K-Means Clustering, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**

* Agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
  **Examples:**
  Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks.

## üß© Key ML Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dataset**         | Collection of data used to train and test ML models.                    |
| **Training Set**    | Used to train the model.                                                |
| **Test Set**        | Used to evaluate model performance.                                     |
| **Validation Set**  | Used for hyperparameter tuning.                                         |
| **Overfitting**     | Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.            |
| **Underfitting**    | Model is too simple and performs poorly on both training and test data. |
| **Hyperparameters** | Parameters set before training (e.g., learning rate, depth).            |

## üìä Model Evaluation Metrics

| Type               | Common Metrics                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Regression**     | MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ Score                       |
| **Classification** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC |
| **Clustering**     | Silhouette Score, Davies‚ÄìBouldin Index         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering

Feature engineering improves model performance by transforming raw data into meaningful features.

* **Handling Missing Data**
* **Encoding Categorical Variables** (Label/One-Hot Encoding)
* **Scaling Features** (Standardization, Normalization)
* **Feature Selection** (Removing irrelevant features)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Bias-Variance Tradeoff

| Term         | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bias**     | Error due to oversimplified model assumptions.                         |
| **Variance** | Error due to model sensitivity to small fluctuations in training data. |

Goal: Find a balance between bias and variance for better generalization.
